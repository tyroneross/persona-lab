/**
 * Shared lens/role library for persona-lab.
 *
 * A "lens" is a distinct review perspective. Selection is by MECE coverage of
 * goals, jobs-to-be-done, and risk — not demographics. At least one adversarial
 * (red-team) lens is required in every panel to counter LLM positivity bias.
 *
 * The six lenses flagged `default_critique: true` are the research-backed
 * starter set for critiquing an artifact (novice, power user, red-team,
 * accessibility, buyer, domain specialist).
